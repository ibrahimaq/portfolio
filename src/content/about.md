Welcome to my corner of the internet. 

I'm a Maths teacher turned web developer. I taught high school mathematics for four years before teaching myself web development and code. I now work for a digital agency based in London where I eat, code and sleep.

It started when I wanted to create a mobile game and learn how to program/code during one of the school summer holidays. It then turned into learning how the web works and over time it became an obsession. Two years later this obsession turned into profession.

Outside of coding, you'll find me reading about the universe and its mysteries, playing the piano or enjoying some family time.
