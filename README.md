  Personal Portfolio Website

## About
This repo houses all my portfolio's website commits. It is powered by React, Gatsby - a static site generator, Contentful - a headless CMS, and hosted on Netlify.

## Stack 
- React
- Gatsby
- Node.js
- GraphQL
- SCSS

## What I learnt
Embarking on this portfolio site journey enabled me to learn a huge variety of technologies. It was an enormous learning curve which includes:

- Gatsby - first time using static site generators.
- GraphQL - creating static and dynamic queries.
- auto generating pages using Gatsby's Node configuration.
- React Helmet - for site metadata/SEO.
- Gatsby's responsive dynamic image plugins.
- headless CMS.
- using third party vendors, EMAILJS, to handle the contact forms.
- reading tonnes of documentation.
- and many more.

## Things to improve on
I think this is still and will always remain a work in progress - there is always something to improve or update. 
Howevver my next steps is to focus on developing a solid, programmatic styling. I feel I did not use SASS to it's full potential which is why this is my first go-to issue.
